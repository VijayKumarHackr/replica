#Replica
A visualizer for CNC machining process which can be embedded with a G-code interpreter. The API for using Replica with your G-code interpreter is simple and intuitive. It is built using pure JavaScript which runs on client side. Hence it can also be run offline, if the html page is once saved on your local machine.

Currently the project is in active development phase.
